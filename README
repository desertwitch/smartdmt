smartdmt is a small utility that provides a simple terminal user interface (TUI)
for inspecting your connected block devices SMART information. It was developed
primarily as a companion application to ShredOS, so that such information can be
observed during disk wiping. The utility also functions as a standalone program.

The TUI acts as a visual wrapper, calling "lsblk" and "smartctl" under the hood
to provide a side-by-side view of all block devices and their SMART information.
The data is automatically refreshed and basic filtering is possible.

For convenience, precompiled static binaries for common architectures are
released through GitHub. These can be installed into "/usr/bin/" or respective
system locations; ensure they are executable by running "chmod +x" before use.

Runtime dependencies:
- lsblk (as part of "util-linux" package)
- smartctl (as part of "smartmontools" package)
